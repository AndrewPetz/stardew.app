# Raw Game Data

These files were taken from the unpacked version of `Stardew Valley/Content`. We used [StardewXnbHack](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewXnbHack#readme) to unpack files. More information on how to do this yourself can be found on the [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Editing_XNB_files).
