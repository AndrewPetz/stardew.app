# Overview
Stardew.app is a next-generation, user-oriented Stardew Valley perfection tracker. The website was born when Jack LaFond and Clemente Solorio, two avid players of the game, decided to get together and create a better community resource.

## Features

- Farmer information + achievements
- Bundle tracking
- Fishing tracking with fish information
- Cooking tracking with recipe ingredients
- Museum and artifact tracking
- Discord OAuth2 login to preserve data across devices

- Perfection tracker
- Crafting tracker
- Farm & forage tracker
- Secret notes tracker
- Ginger Island tracker
